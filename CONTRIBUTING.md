About contributing to GitHub Build Chain

You can contribute to GitHub Build Chain in several ways.

GitHub Build Chain is open source. Anyone can contribute to the code or documentation, reporting issues with the GitHub Build Chain


Issues

Issues are used to track tasks which are reported by users or contributors which can help with.

If you've found something is not described in the documentation - README.md, or something doesn't work in documented and expected way, that should be updated, search the open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a template. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you'd like to be fixed.


Pull requests

A pull request is a way to suggest changes in our repository. When we merge those changes and the version in package.json file is changed the new version of GitHub Build Chain CLI is automatically published on merge.  GitHub Build Chain Action is published when we create a tag and make new Release from it on Github repository.

You should always review your own pull request first, before marking it as ready for review by others.
